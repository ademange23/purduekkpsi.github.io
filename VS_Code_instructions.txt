Make GitHub acc and fork the main repo - this creates a new branch for the user.

download VS code


extensions:
1) Live Preview
2) GitHub Repo

Log in to the GitHub one using same account. 

Because the preview won't work (for now) with virtual workspaces - GitHub fork is online - one must have a local copy of the fork.

Use the clone command to store a local copy of the whole (forked) repo. It's from here that one can make changes and push to their personal branch. 

After changes are made in VS code to this local branch, then committed to the forked branch on github itself, a pull request must be made to sync changes to the main psi repo.
This is decided on by whomever is running the github account at the time.
