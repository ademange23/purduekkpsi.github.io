Make GitHub acc and fork the main repo - this creates a new branch for the user.

download VS code


extensions:
1) Live Preview
2) GitHub Repo

Log in to the GitHub extension using same account. 

Because the preview won't work (for now) with virtual workspaces - GitHub fork is online - one must have a local copy of the fork.

Use the clone command to store a local copy of the whole (forked) repo. It's from here that one can make changes and push to their personal branch. 

After changes are made in VS code to this local branch (whatever edits), then committed to the forked branch on github itself (through the source control tab on VSCode), a pull request must be made to sync changes to the main Psi repo.
This is decided on by whomever is running the github account at the time. Notify them of changes, but current suggestion is to update site maybe once a month as needed.



LIVE Preview
to show the live preview of any page you're working on, make sure the extension is installed first.
Then, while editing an HTML doc, you can click the icon in top right to start the live preview. You can also right click a doc to run the same command. 
Honestly, read the extension documentation for better tips.
