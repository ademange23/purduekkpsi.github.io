Make GitHub acc and fork the main repo.

download VS code


extensions:
1) Live Preview
2) GitHub Repo

Log in to the GitHub one using same account. 

Because the preview won't work (for now) with virtual workspaces - GitHub fork is online - one must have a local copy of the fork.

Use the clone command to store a local copy of the whole (forked) repo. It's from here that one can make changes and push to their personal fork online.
